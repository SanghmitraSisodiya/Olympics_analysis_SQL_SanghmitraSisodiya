## About the Dataset
### Context

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Before uploading on Kaggle, this was scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. The R code was used to scrape and wrangle the data. 

## Objective 
To understand and analyse about how the Olympics have evolved over time by using SQL  (You can see my live dashboard Here, I have used [Power BI](https://www.novypro.com/profile_projects/sanghmitrasisodiya) ), 
including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.

## Note :- 
The data set is really huge, with approx. 3Lakh rows.

This has been one of the most challenging Data Analysis projects in terms of ETL

I have used Dense rank format for the ranking system

oh table refers to the olympic history details

Nocr table refers to the region, nationality notes and details

I have used SQL, Excel and PowerBI for the end to end Data Analysis and Data Visualization
