## About the Dataset
### Context

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. Before uploading on Kaggle, this was scraped from www.sports-reference.com in May 2018. The R code was used to scrape and wrangle the data. 

## Objective 
To understand and analyse about how the Olympics have evolved over time by using SQL  (You can see my live dashboard Here, I have used [Power BI](https://www.novypro.com/profile_projects/sanghmitrasisodiya) ), 
including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.

### Content
The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). The columns are:

ID - Unique number for each athlete

Name - Athlete's name

Sex - M or F

Age - Integer

Height - In centimeters

Weight - In kilograms

Team - Team name

NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code

Games - Year and season

Year - Integer

Season - Summer or Winter

City - Host city

Sport - Sport

Event - Event

Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

## Some Important Insights - 
### 1. The first Event of the Olympics had no participation of female athletes. 
### 2. The female participation increased significantly in late 1950's and saw big increase in 1980's.
### 3. The participation rate of athletes keeps increasing in Winter games.
### 4. 1916, 1940 & 1944 summer Olympic games and 1940 & 1944 winter Olympic games didn't happen.
### 5. World War was the reason for this.  
### 6. Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. 
### 7. Summer Games have more participations than Winter Games
### 8. However, the rate of participation of athletes in Summer Games have become stagnant recently.
